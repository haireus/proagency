                <p class="news-entry-summary-excerpt">
                  A 30-day experiment across profiles, Fanpages, and brand new
                  pages shows Facebook is now driven by interest-based discovery
                  instead of follower reach.
                </p>
              </summary>
              <div class="news-entry-content">
                <p>
                  After 30 days of testing three channel types side by side, it
                  is clear that Facebook has shifted to a TikTok-style discovery
                  engine. The test lineup covered:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Personal profile:</strong> Packed with real friends
                    and long-time connections.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Existing Fanpage:</strong> A community between 5,000
                    and 100,000 followers.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Brand new page:</strong> Just launched with zero
                    followers.
                    <figure class="news-entry-image">
                      <img
                        src="./assets/images/proagency-view.jpeg"
                        alt="Pro Agency showcasing Facebook channel tests across devices"
                      />
                    </figure>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  Across all three, the same pattern emerged: Facebook now
                  prioritizes content that keeps people engaged over the size of
                  your existing audience.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Facebook no longer prioritizes your followers</h3>
                <p>
                  The follower-based distribution era is gone. Instead of
                  automatically showing your post to 10 to 20 percent of your
                  friends or followers, Facebook now evaluates interest signals
                  first. If you publish content about weight loss, it reaches
                  people already immersed in that topic, even if they have never
                  heard of you. Meanwhile, inactive followers effectively become
                  dead reach. That is why creators with massive pages can now
                  see fewer views than a brand new profile that nails audience
                  interest.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Outdated, boring content gets punished</h3>
                <p>
                  Facebook is rewarding content that stops the scroll. Posts
                  that hold attention with stories, insights, or tension get
                  lifted, while traditional ads, link drops, and repetitive
                  pitches sink. The metric that matters is how long people
                  linger. Every additional second is a positive signal because
                  Facebook only wins when the user keeps scrolling inside the
                  app.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  3. What creators and business owners should do right now
                </h3>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Create content that forces a pause.</strong>
                    Address what your audience wants, needs, or is actively
                    searching for. Use sharp hooks such as &ldquo;The truth
                    about...,&rdquo; &ldquo;99% of people get this wrong,&rdquo;
                    or &ldquo;The story of how I almost went broke.&rdquo;
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tell stories before you sell.</strong>
                    People tune out hard sells, but pay attention to real
                    journeys. Share failures, comebacks, and lessons. Let the
                    offer appear as the natural conclusion to the story.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Build a community, not just a feed.</strong>
                    Comment, reply, DM, and create spaces where conversation
                    continues. Capture leads into your own pond so the
                    relationship continues beyond the newsfeed.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>
                  4. Facebook is &ldquo;forcing&rdquo; everyone to create so it
                  can profit from views
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Meta is gamifying creation with Rising Creator badges, weekly
                  rewards, ranks, missions, and levels. The objective is simple:
                  make you publish more so users stay longer and generate more
                  ad inventory. The platform pays you up front, but it earns far
                  more on the back end. Stay strategic, stay diversified.
                </p>

                <h3>
                  5. Traffic is like a school of fish &#8212; it never stays in
                  one place
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Today&apos;s viral hit becomes tomorrow&apos;s forgotten post.
                  If you are not moving traffic into owned assets like Zalo,
                  email, groups, or your CRM, you are feeding someone else&apos;s
                  pond. Capture attention while you have it and redirect it to
                  channels you control.
                </p>

                <h3>6. The long-term strategy: Build your own pond</h3>
                <p>
                  Treat your content as the doorway, not the destination. Behind
                  every post should be an ecosystem: a lead list, a private
                  community, a signature offer. With that structure in place,
                  you survive platform outages, algorithm shifts, and pay cuts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Facebook has become a full algorithm battlefield where smart,
                  story-driven content wins. The enduring playbook is simple:
                  create magnetic content, pull traffic into your own pond, and
                  convert that attention into long-term assets for your business.

                  Proactively protect your business with this five point
                  checklist to significantly lower your risk:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Audit Your Landing Page:</strong>
                    Ensure its message, policies, and contact information align
                    perfectly with your ad. Facebook&apos;s AI flags anything
                    that feels inconsistent.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Avoid Trigger Words:</strong>
                    Steer clear of absolute claims like &quot;guaranteed,&quot;
                    sensitive health terms, or dramatic before and after
                    imagery.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Warm Up New Accounts:</strong>
                    Do not launch a new account with a massive budget. Start
                    with smaller, engagement focused campaigns for a few days to
                    build trust.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Maintain Your Fan Page:</strong>
                    Keep the page active, professional, and updated. Complete
                    business information and consistent posting boost overall
                    credibility.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Use a Clean Payment Method:</strong>
                    A single, reputable credit card is far safer than juggling
                    multiple virtual payments or cards linked to previously
                    banned accounts.

                  Why Is a Fanpage Not Allowed to Advertise? 4 Main Reasons
                </h2>
                <p class="news-entry-summary-excerpt">
                  Discover the four compliance pillars Facebook reviews when it
                  blocks Fanpages from running ads, and how to stay on the safe

              <div class="news-entry-content">
                <p>
                  When a Facebook Fanpage loses advertising privileges, the
                  fallout is immediate: stalled campaigns, lost momentum, and a
                  frustrated team trying to understand what went wrong. Here are
                  the four areas Facebook reviews most closely when deciding
                  whether a page can advertise.
                </p>
                <h3>Violating Advertising Policies and Community Standards</h3>
                <p>
                  This is the most common cause of restrictions. Facebook&apos;s
                  policy list is long, and violations in any of these areas can
                  shut a page down fast:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Prohibited Content:</strong>
                    Promoting illegal products or services, tobacco, weapons,
                    unsafe supplements, or adult content.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Restricted Content:</strong>
                    Advertising alcohol, dating services, or financial products
                    without proper targeting and permissions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Misleading or Deceptive Practices:</strong>
                    Using clickbait, making false claims, or promising
                    unrealistic outcomes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Discriminatory Practices:</strong>
                    Targeting or messaging that excludes people based on
                    personal attributes such as race, religion, or sexual
                    orientation.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Sensational Content:</strong>
                    Shocking, disrespectful, or excessively violent imagery or
                    text.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Page Quality and Reputation Issues</h3>
                <p>
                  Facebook monitors the health of your page. Warning signs
                  include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Too Many Rejected Ads:</strong>
                    A repeated pattern of denials signals deeper compliance
                    problems.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Negative Feedback:</strong>
                    Frequent hides, mutes, or spam reports hurt page
                    credibility.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Low Page Quality Score:</strong>
                    Facebook tracks quality metrics internally; low scores lead
                    to restrictions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Untrustworthy Presence:</strong>
                    Sparse content, missing business details, or few followers
                    create distrust.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Account and Security Issues</h3>
                <p>
                  Security problems or suspicious behavior around the ad account
                  can also freeze your advertising ability:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Payment Problems:</strong>
                    Failed payments, outstanding balances, or a flagged card are
                    fast ways to trigger a shutdown.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Unusual Activity:</strong>
                    Sudden spikes in spend or mass ad creation look suspicious
                    to the algorithm.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Circumventing Systems:</strong>
                    Reopening banned ads or cycling through accounts after bans
                    invites permanent removal.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Compromised Access:</strong>
                    If Facebook suspects a hack, it will restrict assets to
                    prevent damage.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Landing Page and Website Violations</h3>
                <p>
                  The experience after someone clicks your ad matters just as
                  much as the ad itself:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Non-functional Landing Pages:</strong>
                    Broken links or irrelevant destinations lead to rejections.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Misleading Content:</strong>
                    The landing page must deliver exactly what the ad promises.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Policy Violations On-Site:</strong>
                    Even compliant ads can be restricted if the destination page
                    breaks Facebook rules.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Keep your assets healthy by scheduling regular policy reviews,
                  monitoring page quality metrics, and aligning all audience
                  touchpoints. Prevention is always faster than an appeal.

                  Facebook Business Manager (BM) is the mission control for any
                  serious advertiser. The big question today is whether you
                  should build your own BM or rent a pre-warmed one. Here is a
                  clear look at both paths so you can pick the right route for

                <p>
                  Launching your own BM via business.facebook.com ties assets
                  directly to your verified identity and gives you maximum
                  control.
                </p>
                <h4>The Advantages of Creating Your Own BM</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Full Control and Ownership:</strong>
                    Everything belongs to you. Access, data, pixels, and pages
                    stay in-house.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Maximum Security:</strong>
                    You manage logins, two factor authentication, and security
                    policies without relying on a third party.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Cost Effective to Start:</strong>
                    Creating a BM is free. Your only cost is ad spend.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Long-Term Trust with Meta:</strong>
                    Consistent, policy compliant spending increases account
                    trust and unlocks higher limits over time.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Low Initial Spend Limits:</strong>
                    New accounts often start with very conservative budgets.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Higher Ban Risk Early On:</strong>
                    Fresh accounts face stricter reviews from Facebook&apos;s
                    AI.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>The Warm Up Period:</strong>
                    Scaling requires patience, gradual spending, and consistent
                    compliance.
                  </li>

                <ul>
                  <li>Established businesses with a long term vision.</li>
                  <li>
                    Teams that value data ownership and full visibility into

                <h3>Renting a Business Manager: The Fast Track to Scaling</h3>
                <p>
                  Renting means partnering with an agency that provides access
                  to high trust BMs that already passed Meta&apos;s reliability
                  checks.
                </p>
                <h4>The Advantages of Renting a BM</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>High or No Spending Limits:</strong>
                    Skip the warm up phase and start with the budget you need.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Reduced Personal Risk:</strong>
                    If a rented account is disabled, your personal profile stays
                    unaffected.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Pre-Warmed Account History:</strong>
                    Long standing, healthy ad history can mean faster approvals
                    and more stable campaigns.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>No Ownership:</strong>
                    The provider controls access and could remove it without

                  <li>
                    Affiliate marketers or dropshippers scaling aggressively.

                  <li>Advertisers operating in gray hat niches.</li>
                  <li>
                    Teams that lost their own BM and need a fast, temporary

                <h3>Final Verdict: A Hybrid Approach Is Often Best</h3>
                <p>
                  Most businesses benefit from running both options in parallel.
                  Build your own BM for long term control, security, and brand
                  equity. Supplement it with a trusted rented BM when you need
                  to move fast, test new offers, or protect core spending while
                  appeals are in progress.

                    <strong>Act Human:</strong>
                    Avoid repetitive patterns; vary actions and timing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Be Patient:</strong>
                    Experts recommend at least two weeks of warm up before
                    scaling.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Use Quality Proxies When Needed:</strong>
                    Residential or ISP proxies plus antidetect browsers protect
                    your setup.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Prioritize Consistency:</strong>
                    Moderate, steady activity beats aggressive bursts.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Follow this playbook and you will dramatically increase the
                  trust score of your VIA, reducing the chance of sudden
                  shutdowns when you are ready to scale.

                  experts for high stakes or specialized initiatives.

                  Meta is reshaping Facebook in 2025 with bold investments in
                  AI, hardware, and policy enforcement. Here is what matters
                  most for marketers navigating the new landscape.
                </p>
                <h3>Artificial Intelligence and Breakthrough Products</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Standalone AI Application:</strong>
                    Meta launched a consumer AI app powered by Llama 4 with
                    social features, letting users follow conversations through
                    a Discover tab and personalize interactions via connected
                    Facebook and Instagram accounts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Next Generation Smart Glasses:</strong>
                    The Meta Ray-Ban Display debuted with a monochrome AR
                    screen, allowing message viewing, short video playback, and
                    native AI assistance despite early demo glitches.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>AI Everywhere:</strong>
                    From Facebook Dating to core feeds, Meta is infusing AI
                    assistants and recommendations to keep users engaged and
                    experiences personal.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Platform Updates and User Experience</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Mass Group Suspensions in Vietnam:</strong>
                    Facebook removed numerous large communities in June for
                    violating policies on dangerous organizations, signaling
                    tighter enforcement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Refreshed Interface:</strong>
                    A minimalist layout makes content discovery easier and lets
                    users prioritize what they see. Security upgrades now
                    support biometric and QR code based two factor
                    authentication.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Advertising Policy and Algorithm Changes</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tighter Policies:</strong>
                    Meta is phasing out detailed targeting exclusions and adding
                    new restrictions on custom audiences and privacy sensitive
                    data usage.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Livestream Ads Approved:</strong>
                    Creators can officially promote live video events to boost
                    real time engagement.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Discovery-First Algorithm:</strong>
                    Facebook now prioritizes interest based content, surfacing
                    more Reels and recommendations from accounts users do not
                    follow.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  With rapid innovation comes complexity. Brands must adapt
                  quickly, keep assets compliant, and design creative for an
                  algorithm that rewards relevance over familiarity.
